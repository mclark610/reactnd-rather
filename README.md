description:
    reactnd-rather is a queston answer type application that tracks users answers 
  to questions they and other users create.   It then gives each user a score 
  based on the number of questions answered as well as the number of questions 
  the user generated.

backend:
  the backend is simulated by canned data as well as functions to pull the data.  

redux/data:
  redux will be used to control the state and make fetching data from state more accessible.
  data to store in state:
    users:   // users that have access to the application
    - contains
      - id : user id 
      - name: users full name
      - avatarURL: link to the users avatar

        - either Option One or Two
      - questions: [array]
